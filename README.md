# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Personal Website

This template is built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) and is a personal website for [Mody Amean](https://mody.nyc/). 

It is a simple portfolio website that showcases my friend's photography and achievements. It uses React and Tailwind CSS for styling and is built with Vite for fast development and deployment.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant.


## Devlog
Devlog Website notes:

- The Website has two pages: the home page and the Contact page.
- The home acts like a profile page, with a navigation bar at the top and a portfolio section below it.
- The Contact page has a contact form and a map section. This page is where the client can book an appointment or send a message to Mody for a photo shoot or for other purposes.
